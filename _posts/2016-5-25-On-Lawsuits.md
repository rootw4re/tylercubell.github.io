Yesterday one of my favorite channels on YouTube, [h3h3productions](https://www.youtube.com/user/h3h3Productions), uploaded a video called [We're Being Sued](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEGVOysbC8w) which brought back some unpleasant memories for me. Around this time last year I was dragged into a lawsuit myself. While h3h3productions's outcome is still uncertain, luckily for me the opposing party in my case dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice before it went to trial and got absolutely nothing. My only regret is the settlement agreement didn't require them to admit any wrongdoing. If I had another $10-30k to spare I would have demanded a jury trial on principle. It was personal for me because the they stalked and harassed my family and threatened me based on sensitive personal information I divulged in the past.

I feel that I should share my experiences so anyone going through something similar can gain greater clarity from I've learned in hindsight. In this post I want to highlight the common themes in both of our cases.

## Greedy Plaintiff

Some background: the defendant, h3h3productions, is a YouTube channel that creates reaction videos in which they take short clips from other videos and add their own commentary in order to satirize or otherwise parody the original video. Matt Hosseinzadeh (aka Bold Guy), the plaintiff, alleges that h3h3production's reaction video violates his copyrighted work because it doesn't constitute fair use. 

[Fair use](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/what-is-fair-use/) is defined as any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and “transformative” purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work. Such uses can be done without permission from the copyright owner.

Bold Guy claims the majority of the reaction video is his original video and the commentary section makes up the minority and adds nothing of value to the video. In reality, the video is eleven minutes of substantive commentary with just three minutes of original video. It's also clearly a parody which is one of the strongest established categories of fair use. He goes on to claim that his content included in the reaction video is responsible in part for doubling h3h3production's subscriber count during the period that the video was up (implying he should be entitled to more money). That's simply not true because it was just one video among many dozens of other videos which YouTube analytics can show the total views and revenue for. If that wasn't bad enough, before the lawsuit was filed Bold Guy made a settlement offer (in my view, an extortion attempt) to h3h3productions asking for $4000 and/or a public apology and promotion of his channel for two months in order to drop the suit.

Something similar happened in my case where the opposing party offered to drop the suit in exchange for complete ownership of the product that took me over a year of full-time work to produce. By the way, they had no involvement in creating the product aside from contributing their name and logo in a rebranding effort after the product was already built. That's literally it. Later when their lawsuit was filed, they were seeking $20,000 in damages plus attorney's fees for a pre-revenue product with no customers. Totally unbelievable. I won't get into specifics but suffice it to say some of their claims were totally absurd. The takeaway from this is the other side can make all kinds of outrageous claims and ask for whatever they want but it doesn't mean they're entitled to anything. It's just a scare tactic.

In reality Bold Guy didn't like being poked fun at and knew that he stood to make a substantial amount of money so he chose to sue. I think his motivation is based on greed. In a similar fashion, the guy that sued me made all kinds of phony allegations in an attempt to bully and extort me in hopes of getting something of value which they didn't work for.

## Unscrupulous Lawyer

Bar associations tout the fact that the law profession requires the highest of ethical standards and those who practice law are to be held accountable by those standards. I'm not intimately familiar with standard operating procedure for lawyers but in my view the actions of the opposing counsel in my case were unfair and disgusting.

First of all, the opposing counsel in my case included all kinds of false claims in the complaint that anybody with half a brain and an internet connection could see had little or no merit. Apparently that's a common stategy that has no negative consequences whatsoever. Second, the text was carelessly drafted with numerous typos and it's clear no research was done and no claims were scrutinized before being included. Everything was written verbatim straight out of the mouth of the guy who sued me. Thirdly, if all of that wasn't bad enough, their lawyer timed the serving of the papers so that the 4 day period I had to respond to the lawsuit/injunction included the weekend. So I had to race to draft an emergency motion to stay (with no legal training and no representation at the time) and hand-deliver it to the clerk of court, the day before the preliminary hearing or I would automatically lose by default. If there's a hell, there's a special place in it reserved for this guy.

In the case of h3h3productions, notwithstanding the fact that the video itself is clearly fair use, Bold Guy's lawyer included a claim that h3h3productions earned money through Kickstarter because of the video. This is impossible because they've never had a kickstarter so it's clearly false. Apparently whoever drafts the complaint has free reign to throw in the kitchen sink without regard to reality or the truth. It would have taken him a 2 minute Google search to see they never had a Kickstarter. In such serious circumstances with people's wealth, livelihood, and reputation at stake, how is this not unethical?

For the record I'd also like to add that the opposing counsel in my case was [admonished](http://www.mass.gov/obcbbo/admon2009.htm) (bottom of page NO. 09-18) by the Board of Bar Overseers. Apparently he violated the attorney-client relationship by publishing highly confidential information about a case publicly on the internet. I'm guessing that the guy that sued me must have been rejected by numerous reputable lawyers before settling on a lawyer with such bad track record and a [Ripoff Report](http://www.ripoffreport.com/r/Fein-Law-Offices/Braintree-Massachusetts-02184/Fein-Law-Office-Christopher-Fien-was-given-2000000-to-represent-me-before-the-IRS-Inst-455617) profile with multiple complaints willing to take the case.

## Conclusion

I guess the moral of the story is stick to your guns and don't give into intimidation. I read on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)) that 2% of civil ligitation end in a trial so the odds of avoiding a prolonged and costly legal battle are pretty good. With the public pressure on Bold Guy, I think that it's likely that the lawsuit will be settled. In my case, after I exhibited strength, the guy that sued me retreated lickety-split. Always stand up to bullies. Oh, and never sign a letter of intent thinking you have nothing to lose.
