Sold an old phone on eBay and made the mistake of not paying attention to the shipping section which eBay automatically sets to international. Within 10 minutes the phone gets bought by some guy with a name I can't pronounce living in Ukraine. I'm immediately suspicious.

The buyer:

```
Вячеслав Дехтярчук
dextyrcuc@ukr.net
```

With a shipping address to a Ukranian freight forwarding service:

```
Vyacheslav Dekhtyarchuk 024292
641 Dowd Ave
Meest-America Inc.
Elizabeth , NJ 07201-2116
United States
```

With a [quick Google search](https://community.ebay.com/t5/Shipping-Returns/Has-anyone-shipped-to-Meest-America-in-Elizabeth-NJ/td-p/21959948) I found out that this has the potential to be a scam. bettybunter writes:

I shipped items to the same address to be forwarded to the Ukraine.
now she is saying she didn't get the items and is claiming her money back through paypal.
 
another scammer i think.

```

Called up eBay support to get their opinion and they were absolutely no help. I ended up cancelling the transaction, setting shipping to US only, and in 30 minutes the phone got bought by someone legit. What a PITA.
