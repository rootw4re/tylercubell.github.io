I got the opportunity to go to Philadelphia while I was visiting family for Thanksgiving. I only associate three things when it comes to Philly: Liberty Bell, Ben Franklin, Cheesesteak. So naturally, I insisted on getting myself a genuine Philly Cheesesteak. Well&#8230; sorry to disappoint but it&#8217;s not all that it&#8217;s cracked up to be. I went to Pat&#8217;s King of Steaks (the most well-known) but I heard there are also a few other famous ones like Geno&#8217;s and Ishkabible&#8217;s. I didn&#8217;t visit any other places but I&#8217;m assuming that they&#8217;re all pretty much the same bread-meat-cheese combo.

**My expectation:**

I was expecting this huge sandwich, packed with steak, melted cheese, seasoned to perfection. Part the seas, sound the trumpets, hark the herald angels sing! Nope.

**Reality:**

Here&#8217;s what I got:

1. Cold chewy cafeteria roll.

2. Slice of uninspiring american cheese (or cheese wiz if you&#8217;re really adventurous \*vomits in mouth\*)

3. Scant amount of steak. I demand more cow.

4. Greasy puddle of lard drippings.

5. 9 less dollars. The size of the sandwich was pretty small. Not worth it.

&nbsp;

And I had to wait half an hour in line in the freezing cold! I could make the same thing with Steak-Umms, salt & pepper, any 2 week old deli roll, and processed cheese squares. I don&#8217;t get it.
