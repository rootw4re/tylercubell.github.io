The latest project that I&#8217;m taking on is reducing my electric bill. The house is 100% electric including the heating system &#8211; no gas or oil. The challenge is to find out what changes make the greatest impact. Here are some ideas I&#8217;ve found to help cut down on energy usage.

TLDR;

  1. [LED Light bulbs][1].
  2. Unplug stuff you don&#8217;t use.
  3. Upgrade old appliances.
  4. <del>Jam the spinny thing in your meter socket</del>

## Inventory Your Appliances

Make a list of everything that uses electricity. That way, you&#8217;ll know where to start. Here&#8217;s my list for example:

**Major Appliances**

  * 1x Dryer (energy star)
  * 1x Washing Machine (energy star)
  * 2x Electric Stove
  * 2x Electric Oven
  * 1x Water Heater 50 gallon
  * 1x Fridge (energy star)
  * 1x Fridge (old as hell &#8217;80s?)

**Minor Appliances**

  * 2x Toaster
  * 2x Microwave
  * 1x Garbage Disposal
  * 3x Cable Boxes
  * 2x Desktop Computers

**Heating System**

  * 4x Electric Baseboard
  * 3x Space Heaters

**Lighting**

  * 2x Outside Lights
  * 2x Outside Lamps
  * 2x Spotlights
  * 10x Long Flourescent Tubes
  * 4x Short Flourescent Tubes
  * 21x Light Sockets

&nbsp;

## Where to begin?

So out of this long list, where should you begin? I think the easiest place to start is with the *21 light bulbs.* These days there&#8217;s three main types of lightbulbs. Incandescent, CFL, and LED. Here&#8217;s how they stack up:

So the obvious choice is LED. This is probably the easiest change you can make right now.

You can get LED bulbs on Amazon for about $7.50. They cost $1.23 to run for a year (3 hours a day) and last for over 20 years. It&#8217;s a no brainer!

## Energy Vampires

Chances are you have vampires in your house and you don&#8217;t even know it. I&#8217;m talking about cable boxes (shame on you, Comcast).  Consider turning off your cable box during the day and you can save some $$$.

## Energy Star All The Things!

Upgrade your old appliances to Energy Star certified appliances.

## Power Down Your Devices

If you casually use your desktop PC or laptop, why have it on if you&#8217;re not using it? Go into your operating system&#8217;s control panel and set a conservative power profile. For example, you can automatically power off your monitor after 5 minutes and put the computer to sleep after 15 minutes.

## Water Heater Upgrade

If your water heater is more than 10 years old, consider replacing it with a Hybrid Water Heater. It uses a heat pump to save energy and costs less than 60 cents a day to run. I installed one of these and I can attest that they&#8217;re good. Just keep in mind that it can be a little noisy so it would be better suited to a garage or basement.

## Get a Fancypants Thermostat

If you get a Nest thermostat, it will automatically learn how you heat and cool your home and turn down the heat when you&#8217;re away. It might also be connected to SkyNet but that&#8217;s a story for another time.

From what I&#8217;ve read, some people see an energy savings of 10-30%. Also this solves the problem of your house either being an icebox or a sauna.
