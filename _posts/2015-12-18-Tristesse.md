Listening to [Étude Op. 10, No. 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tude_Op._10,_No._3_(Chopin)) by Chopin, I was wondering why it's more popularly known as "Tristesse" (Sadness). I don't hear sadness at all, in fact the beginning is quite blissful. Following that is a few tense episodes and a return back to the original theme. I bet that name was given by the marketing department at the original publisher in order to sell more copies because according to the Wikipedia article:

{% highlight bash %}
Although this étude is sometimes identified by the names "Tristesse" (Sadness) or "Farewell (L'Adieu)," neither is a name given by Chopin.

On the same token, Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 14 "Sonata Quasi Una Fantasia" got turned into "Moonlight Sonata" thanks to some obscure music critic no one remembers. I think the original heading written by Beethoven is much better fitting.
